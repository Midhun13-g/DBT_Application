# Security Guidelines

## Fixed Security Issues

### Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Moved to environment variables
2. **SQL Injection** - Added input validation and parameterized queries
3. **XSS Vulnerabilities** - Implemented input sanitization
4. **Log Injection** - Added log sanitization
5. **SSRF Attacks** - Added endpoint validation
6. **Insecure WebSocket** - Added protocol detection and message sanitization

### Security Configuration:
- Role-based access control implemented
- CORS properly configured
- JWT token authentication
- Password encryption with BCrypt
- Input validation on all endpoints

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_minimum_32_chars
```

### Security Best Practices:
1. Never commit sensitive data to version control
2. Use environment variables for all secrets
3. Validate all user inputs
4. Sanitize data before logging
5. Use HTTPS in production
6. Implement proper error handling
7. Regular security audits

### Production Deployment:
1. Set strong JWT secret (minimum 32 characters)
2. Use secure database credentials
3. Enable HTTPS
4. Configure proper CORS origins
5. Set up proper logging and monitoring
